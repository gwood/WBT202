This code is a derivative of the code found at

git clone git://gist.github.com/538348.git

The code herein halts at the first error.  Typically the code will
resume at that point once the error is repaired. 

A setup.gps program is provided to copy back the data to the source to
permit the get.gps program to run once again.

So a test cycle runs like this:

$ ./setup.gps
$ ./get.gps

I place these files on the gps itself so that I can have an inplace backup.

How I installed this on the WBT202 GPS device:

$ cd '/Volumes/NO NAME'
$ git clone file:///Users/gwood/Documents/Stanford-iPhone/Winter-2010/Depot/WBT-202_utility

Now we have a true copy of the directory that can be 'pulled' when updates are needed.

$ cd WBT-202_utility
$ git pull

I make changes in the original files on disk and then pull them to the GPS device.
