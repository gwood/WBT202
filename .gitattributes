# The line in .gitattributes treats your Xcode project file as a
# binary. This prevents Git from trying to fix newlines, show it in
# diffs, and excludes it from merges. Note that you will still see it
# shown as a conflict in merges, although the file wonâ€™t have
# changed. Simply commit it and things should be good.

# To prevent diff use this
# *.pbxproj -crlf -diff -merge

# To allow diff - use this.
*.pbxproj -crlf -merge
