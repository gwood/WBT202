# For Xcode and Git to work smoothly with each other, you need to make
# sure Git treats Xcode project files properly. You do this by
# configuring Git via .gitignore and .gitattributes. Create these files
# in your repoâ€™s root folder and add the following lines:

# xcode noise
/build/*
*.pbxuser
*.mode1v3

# old skool
.svn

# osx noise
.DS_Store
